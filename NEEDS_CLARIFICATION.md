# Tasks Requiring Clarification

Generated: 2025-01-26

## Ambiguous or Unclear TODOs

### 1. Content Source Requirements
**TODO**: "Implement site-specific parsers (100+ sources)"
**Questions**:
- Which 100+ sources specifically?
- Priority order for implementation?
- Are there existing APIs we should use instead of scraping?
- Legal/robots.txt compliance for each source?

### 2. Ranking Algorithm Specifics
**TODO**: "Create multi-factor scoring system"
**Questions**:
- What specific factors should be included?
- How should weights be distributed?
- Should this be ML-based or rule-based initially?
- Performance requirements (ranking speed)?

### 3. Vector Database Configuration
**TODO**: "Create Pinecone index configuration"
**Questions**:
- Expected scale (millions of embeddings)?
- Dimension size for embeddings?
- Metadata fields to include?
- Backup strategy for vector data?

### 4. Authentication Scope
**TODO**: "Implement OAuth 2.0 authentication"
**Questions**:
- Which OAuth providers (Google, GitHub, etc.)?
- Support for enterprise SSO?
- User roles and permissions structure?
- Session management requirements?

### 5. Rate Limiting Rules
**TODO**: "Implement rate limiting middleware"
**Questions**:
- Specific limits per tier/user type?
- Should limits be configurable at runtime?
- Burst allowances?
- Rate limit headers format?

### 6. Monitoring Metrics
**TODO**: "Create custom metrics for business KPIs"
**Questions**:
- Which specific KPIs to track?
- Real-time vs batch metrics?
- Data retention period?
- Alerting thresholds?

## Vague Implementation Details

### 1. "Optimize this"
Found in several places without specifics:
- Tag taxonomy optimization
- Performance tuning playbook
- Index optimization strategy

**Needs**: Specific performance targets and bottlenecks to address

### 2. "Implement fallback mechanisms"
**Context**: For failed scrapes, API outages, etc.
**Needs**: Specific fallback strategies and retry policies

### 3. "Create comprehensive tests"
**Context**: Unit test coverage goals
**Needs**: Specific coverage targets, critical paths to test

## Technical Decisions Needed

### 1. Caching Strategy
- Cache TTLs for different data types
- Cache invalidation rules
- Memory vs disk caching decisions

### 2. API Versioning Approach
- URL path versioning vs header versioning
- Deprecation timeline
- Backward compatibility requirements

### 3. Deployment Strategy
- Blue-green vs canary deployments
- Rollback procedures
- Database migration strategy in production

## Business Logic Clarifications

### 1. Content Quality Scoring
- What constitutes "quality" content?
- How to handle different content types?
- Language requirements?

### 2. Tag Taxonomy
- Hierarchical vs flat structure?
- Maximum tags per article?
- Tag evolution/deprecation process?

### 3. User Preferences
- What preferences to track?
- Privacy considerations?
- Default preferences for new users?

## External Dependencies

### 1. API Keys and Services
- Which services require paid plans?
- Rate limits for external APIs?
- Fallback if services are unavailable?

### 2. Infrastructure Requirements
- Minimum cluster size for Kubernetes?
- Database size projections?
- Bandwidth requirements for scraping?

## Action Items

1. **Schedule stakeholder meeting** to clarify business requirements
2. **Create technical design documents** for ambiguous components
3. **Define acceptance criteria** for each major feature
4. **Establish performance benchmarks** for critical operations
5. **Document API rate limits** for all external services

## Priority Clarifications Needed

**High Priority** (Blocking development):
1. OAuth provider selection
2. Initial content sources list (top 20)
3. Basic ranking factors
4. Rate limiting rules

**Medium Priority** (Can start with assumptions):
1. Caching TTLs
2. Monitoring metrics
3. Tag taxonomy structure

**Low Priority** (Can defer):
1. Performance optimization targets
2. Advanced ML features
3. Personalization rules
