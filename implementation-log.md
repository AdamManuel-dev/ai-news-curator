## Summary Statistics
- **Total Tasks Identified**: 185
- **P0 (Critical)**: 98 tasks
- **P1 (High)**: 67 tasks
- **P2 (Medium)**: 17 tasks
- **P3 (Low)**: 3 tasks
- **Completed**: 9 (from initial project setup)
- **In Progress**: 1
- **Remaining**: 175

## Next Priority Tasks
Based on dependencies and criticality:

1. **Git hooks setup** (P1) - depends on ESLint configuration ✅
2. **CI/CD Pipeline** (P0) - critical infrastructure
3. **Database schema design** (P0) - foundation for all features
4. **Dependency injection container** (P0) - core architecture
5. **Error handling middleware** (P0) - essential for API stability

## Implementation Strategy
Following dependency order and priority levels:
- Phase 1: Complete remaining infrastructure setup
- Phase 2: Establish core backend services
- Phase 3: Implement core features in parallel where possible
- Testing integrated throughout rather than waiting for Phase 6

## Notes
- Initial project setup already completed (9 items marked as done)
- Focus on P0 tasks first, then P1
- Track test coverage throughout implementation
- Document any architectural decisions in separate ADR files
