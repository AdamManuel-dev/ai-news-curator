- ✅ ~~Implement Redis cache layer~~ - Can start parallel

#### Group 2: Core Application Layer
- ✅ ~~Implement dependency injection container~~ - CRITICAL for architecture
- ✅ ~~Implement error handling middleware~~ - Ready to implement
- ✅ ~~Create request validation middleware~~ - Ready to implement
- ✅ ~~Implement response serialization~~ - Ready to implement
- ✅ ~~Add CORS configuration~~ - Quick win
- ✅ ~~Implement HTTPS/TLS configuration~~ - Security requirement

#### Group 3: Authentication (Can start but complex)
- ✅ ~~Implement OAuth 2.0 authentication~~ - Large task, can start

## Next High-Priority TODO Items Analysis

### Ready for Immediate Implementation (P0 - Critical)
1. **Create Helm charts for deployment** - Well-scoped infrastructure task
2. **Configure log aggregation (ELK or similar)** - Monitoring enhancement 
3. **Set up alerting rules and notifications** - Monitoring enhancement
4. **Implement database connection pooling** - Performance improvement
5. **Create backup and recovery procedures** - Data safety critical

### Major Features Needing Completion
1. **Web Scraper tool** - Base classes exist, needs site-specific parsers
2. **Content Discovery Orchestrator** - Depends on scrapers/RSS
3. **ML-based tagging engine** - Core feature, not started
4. **Content ranking algorithm** - Core feature, not started
5. **Vector Database setup** - Pinecone integration incomplete

## Updated Next Priority Tasks (P0 - Critical)
### Immediate Implementation (This Week)
1. **Design and implement database schema** [2-3 days]
2. **Implement dependency injection container** [2 days]
3. **Set up Prometheus metrics collection** [1 day]
4. **Implement Redis cache layer** [1 day]
5. **Implement error handling middleware** [1 day]

### Next Wave (Depends on Above)
6. **Create base service and repository classes** [2 days]
7. **Create database migration system** [1 day]
8. **Create Grafana dashboards** [1 day]
9. **Implement rate limiting middleware** [2 days]
10. **Create request validation middleware** [1 day]

## Implementation Strategy & Recommendations

### Critical Observations
1. **Timeline Risk**: 185 tasks with 22-week timeline = ~8.4 tasks/week required
2. **Current Progress**: 31 completed in unknown timeframe (need velocity metrics)
3. **Blocking Dependencies**: Database schema blocks ~40% of remaining tasks
4. **Parallel Opportunities**: Only 10-11 P0 tasks can start immediately

### Recommended Approach
#### Week 1-2: Foundation Sprint
- **Team 1**: Database Schema + Migration System (3 devs)
- **Team 2**: DI Container + Core Services (2 devs)
- **Team 3**: Monitoring (Prometheus + Grafana) (1 dev)
- **Team 4**: Redis + Caching Layer (1 dev)

#### Week 3-4: Core Services Sprint
- Authentication system (OAuth, JWT)
- Rate limiting implementation
- Base repository patterns
- API framework completion

#### Week 5-8: Feature Development (Parallel Teams)
- **Discovery Team**: Scrapers, RSS, APIs
- **ML Team**: Tagging, ranking algorithms
- **Search Team**: Vector DB, search implementation

### Risk Mitigation
1. **Scope Reduction Options**:
   - Defer P2/P3 tasks (saves ~20 tasks)
   - Reduce initial source count (100+ → 20-30)
   - MVP without personalization engine
   - Basic ranking instead of ML-based

2. **Acceleration Options**:
   - Use existing libraries (Passport.js for auth)
   - PostgreSQL full-text search before Pinecone
   - Start with simple tagging, iterate to ML

### Quality Gates
- [ ] Database schema reviewed and approved
- [ ] API design documented (OpenAPI spec first)
- [ ] Security review before auth implementation
- [ ] Performance benchmarks defined early

## Notes
- Some tasks already completed but not reflected in TODO.md
- Database schema appears partially done (schema.sql exists)
- Error handling and DI container seem implemented
- Need to reconcile TODO.md with actual codebase
